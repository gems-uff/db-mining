# NOTE: Everytime we add a new conda dependency, we need to remove the conda environment and create it again.
#       This is a recommendation of Conda when we mix conda and pip packages
#       More info at: https://www.anaconda.com/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment/
#       "If modifications are needed to the environment, it is best to create a new environment rather
 #           than running conda after pip."
